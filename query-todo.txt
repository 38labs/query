Remove internal model

Can we iterate over rows back from db instead somehow (in model)


what do I want to call - 

users.Find(x)
users.Where(xxx)

.First()
.Last()
.Rows()

// Then all the rows can be used to create db. 


// Can we do this in the model?
rows, err := q.Rows()
for 

// We could do this in models?
users.Fetch(q)

I'd like something that:


doesnt' use reflect
doesn't embed models or knowledge of models



Make API consistent - 

Fetch() (fetch first/one)
FetchAll()

Fetch should call FetchAll but just take first entry?


remove internal use of other array fetch method...



I definitely think you should try passing models an sql.Row, and scanning into that, OR we could request a struct from the model

row := db.QueryRow("SELECT id, first_name, last_name, age FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1)

row.Scan(&user.Id, &user.FirstName, &user.LastName, &user.Age)
